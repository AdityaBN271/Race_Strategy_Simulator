# 🏎️ Race Strategy Simulator

A Python + Streamlit web app that simulates and compares two race strategies based on:

- Tire degradation
- Fuel load effect
- Pit stop penalties
- Total race time calculation

🚀 The app generates a **lap-time evolution graph** for both strategies, and exports a 📄 **PDF report** that:
- Summarizes average lap times
- Lists pit stops
- Explains which strategy is better (and why)
